# Australian_States_Game
In this project using Python, the Turtle, and Pandas libraries and managing CSV files I created a game where the user will try to guess all the Australian states. In case not all the states are guessed, a CSV file will be created with the missing states. 
All the required steps to run the game are in the Documentation file.
Enjoy! 🗺️🤔
